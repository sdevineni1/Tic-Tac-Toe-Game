# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in Python. It is designed to demonstrate basic Python programming skills, including the use of functions, loops, and conditionals. The game can be played on the command line and supports two players.

## Files
- **TicTacToe.py:** The main game file that you run to start a game. It handles the game loop, player input, and display of the game board.
- **checkWin.py:** A utility script that includes the function to check for a winning move in the game. It's imported and used in the main game file.

## How to Setup
To run this game, you will need Python installed on your system. Python 3 is recommended. 

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: git clone <[Tic_Tac_Toe.git](https://github.com/sdevineni1/Tic_Tac_Toe.git)>
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game.
3. Run the game using Python: python TicTacToe.py.
4. Ensure checkWin.py is in the same directory as TicTacToe.py.

## How to Play
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is considered a draw.
